			<p>Ballet originated in the Italian Renaissance courts of the 15th century. Noblemen and women were treated to lavish events, especially wedding celebrations, where dancing and music created an elaborate spectacle. Dancing masters taught the steps to the nobility, and the court participated in the performances.There doesn't seem to be one individual who invented ballet, but King Louis XIV is credited with expanding its popularity and helping it evolve into the dance known today. There were also other individuals who contributed various elements that played a huge role in the formation of ballet.At first, the dancers wore masks, layers upon layers of brocaded costuming, pantaloons, large headdresses, and ornaments. Such restrictive clothing was sumptuous to look at but difficult to move in. Dance steps were composed of small hops, slides, curtsies, promenades, and gentle turns. Dancing shoes had small heels and resembled formal dress shoes rather than any contemporary ballet shoe we might recognize today.In the early twentieth century, the Russian theatre producer Serge Diaghilev brought together some of that country's most talented dancers, choreographers, composers, singers, and designers to form a group called the Ballet Russes. The Ballet Russes toured Europe and America, presenting a wide variety of ballets. Here in America, ballet grew in popularity during the 1930's when several of Diaghilev's dancers left his company to work with and settle in the U.S.

			<p>Why should you do Ballet?Ballet improves the body's posture and balance, which contributes to a leaner, more elegant form. It also improves bone development. Confidence and self-esteem develop as ballet dancers learn and conquer new movements and become more confident in their ability to apply themselves, work hard, and master tasks.Ballet also gives pleasure to those who watch it, through aesthetic emotion, since in them so-called mirror neurons are activated, which make the spectator equate to the dancer.t teaches kids strength, discipline, and rhythm. If you are looking for a great way to help your child socialize with other children, get the exercise they need, and learn great life skills, ballet classes are the perfect way to accomplish these goals.Ballet dancers must be capable of moving their bodies in all directions as well as maintain their postures for lengthy periods of time. Balance and coordination teach children how to move well, while ballet trains them to coordinate their movement with music.Dancing is a great way to overcome these negative feelings because the exercise and emotional responses to the music we're hearing can increase the release of dopamine in different parts of the brain. As dopamine levels go up, we can shake off some of those negative feelings and float into a euphoric state.It breaks a body. Most ballet dancers are completely shot by their mid-20s, and many will suffer lifelong disabilities from the effort. Pound for pound, ballerinas are some of the most intense athletes out there.One of the best things about ballet is that it can be enjoyed at any age. Whether you're 5 or 85, there's always something to learn and appreciate about this beautiful art form.Ballet engages many muscles throughout your body to help you maintain balance, bend and stretch, as well as jump. We call this remodeling of our muscles “toning”. We are also constantly stretching the muscles, which lengthens them and gives us that beautiful ballerina form.
